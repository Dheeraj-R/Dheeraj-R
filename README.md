- 👋 Hi, I’m Dheeraj. I have 7 projects in private because they contain confidential things. Lazy to rework them to public.
- 👀 I’m interested in server side web application building and discord bot coding. These topics intrigue me as of now but ofc I'm open to learn anything that's cool XD
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web app building and coding of discord bots. I use node js and python.
 I have already worked on 3 discord bots that help me maintain my server with over 2k members. 
 I'm working on building a website that organises/directs interested people to the original tourism platform. it's complicated but yea.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding discord bots from scratch, and i am willing to learn more ofc XD
